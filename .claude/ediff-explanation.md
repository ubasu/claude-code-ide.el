# Summary of Commit 08790b7: Enhanced Ediff Behavior for GUI Environments

This commit significantly improves the ediff integration in `claude-code-ide.el`, addressing user workflow issues and adding flexible customization. Here's what changed:

## Problem Being Solved

The original implementation had three main issues:
1. **Forced side-by-side layout** made it hard to see full lines
2. **Terminal-style control panel** affected all ediff sessions system-wide
3. **Hidden Claude buffer** during diff review prevented seeing Claude's thought process

## Three Major Enhancements

### 1. Customizable Buffer Orientation (`claude-code-ide-ediff-split-orientation`)

**New in:** `claude-code-ide.el:199-207`, `claude-code-ide-mcp-handlers.el:649-657`

Allows users to choose how comparison buffers are arranged:
- `'vertical` (default): Top-and-bottom layout for easier line reading
- `'horizontal`: Side-by-side for aligned comparison
- `'sensible`: Let Emacs decide based on window dimensions

**Implementation:** Maps to appropriate split functions (`split-window-vertically`, `split-window-horizontally`, `split-window-sensibly`)

### 2. Customizable Control Panel Style (`claude-code-ide-ediff-control-panel-style`)

**New in:** `claude-code-ide.el:209-218`, `claude-code-ide-mcp-handlers.el:640-647`

Controls ediff control panel appearance:
- `'auto` (default): GUI-style in graphical Emacs, terminal-style in terminal
- `'gui`: Always use separate small window (`ediff-setup-windows-default`)
- `'terminal`: Always use single-line panel (`ediff-setup-windows-plain`)

**Impact:** No longer pollutes global ediff settings

### 3. Smart Frame Management in GUI Mode

**New in:** `claude-code-ide-mcp-handlers.el:101-159`, Lines 264-301, 591-625

The most sophisticated enhancement. In GUI mode when `claude-code-ide-show-claude-window-in-ediff` is `t`:

**Key Functions:**
- `claude-code-ide-mcp--find-claude-frame` (101-117): Locates frame containing Claude buffer
- `claude-code-ide-mcp--choose-ediff-frame` (119-139): Determines ediff frame
  - Single frame: Creates new frame for ediff
  - Multiple frames: Finds frame different from Claude's

**Workflow:**
1. Capture original frame before any changes (line 593)
2. Choose target frame for ediff (line 602)
3. Store both `claude-frame` and `ediff-frame` in diff-info (lines 613-614)
4. Switch to target frame BEFORE starting ediff (lines 620-625)
5. After ediff opens, display Claude in its original frame if frames differ (lines 278-287)
6. Raise and focus appropriate frame based on `claude-code-ide-focus-claude-after-ediff` (lines 289-301)

**Result:** Users can see Claude's reasoning while reviewing diffs in a separate frame

## Documentation Updates

- **`.claude/ediff-instructions.md`**: New file documenting requirements and desired behavior
- **`CLAUDE.md`**: Added comprehensive "Ediff Configuration" section (lines 82-103)
- **`README.org`**: Added detailed configuration examples with code snippets (lines 253-314)

## Backward Compatibility

- Terminal mode behavior unchanged
- Setting `claude-code-ide-show-claude-window-in-ediff` to `nil` preserves original behavior
- All new features are opt-in through customization variables with sensible defaults

This commit demonstrates thoughtful UX design, addressing real workflow pain points while maintaining flexibility and backward compatibility. The frame management implementation is particularly elegant, handling edge cases like single vs. multiple frames gracefully.

## Technical Improvement: Removing `unwind-protect`

### Old Version (with `unwind-protect`)

```elisp
(let ((old-setup-fn ediff-window-setup-function)
      (old-split-fn ediff-split-window-function)
      (ediff-control-buffer-suffix (format "<%s>" tab-name)))
  (unwind-protect
      (progn
        (setq ediff-window-setup-function 'ediff-setup-windows-plain
              ediff-split-window-function 'split-window-horizontally)
        (ediff-buffers buffer-A buffer-B))
    ;; Restore original values
    (setq ediff-window-setup-function old-setup-fn
          ediff-split-window-function old-split-fn)))
```

**Purpose:** The old code used `setq` to **mutate global variables**. The `unwind-protect` ensured that even if `ediff-buffers` threw an error, the global `ediff-window-setup-function` and `ediff-split-window-function` would be restored to their original values. Without this protection, an error would leave the user's global ediff configuration permanently changed to the IDE-specific settings.

### New Version (without `unwind-protect`)

```elisp
(let ((ediff-control-buffer-suffix (format "<%s>" tab-name))
      (ediff-window-setup-function setup-fn)
      (ediff-split-window-function split-fn))
  (ediff-buffers buffer-A buffer-B))
```

**Why no `unwind-protect` needed:** The new code uses `let` bindings to create **temporary local bindings** that shadow the global variables. When the `let` form exits (normally or via error), these local bindings are automatically discarded and the global values are restored. This is a fundamental feature of lexical scoping in Emacs Lisp.

### Key Insight

- **Old approach**: Explicit mutation + explicit cleanup = need for `unwind-protect`
- **New approach**: Lexical shadowing + automatic scope cleanup = no cleanup needed

The new version is more elegant and robust because it relies on Emacs Lisp's scoping rules rather than manual save/restore logic. It's also safer because there's no possibility of forgetting to restore a variableâ€”the language runtime handles it automatically.
